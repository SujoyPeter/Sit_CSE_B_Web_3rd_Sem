                The US state department said it was “incredibly” concerned about Russia’s campaign of hybrid warfare
                against
                the west, amid fears it will escalate following Ukraine’s first use of US-made long-range missiles on
                targets inside Russia, after the Biden administration lifted restrictions on their use.

            Russia has promised an “appropriate” response to the new policy, and has engaged in nuclear sabre-rattling
            by changing its nuclear doctrine in recent days. However, western officials believe the thrust of the
            Russian response may come not on the battlefield in Ukraine but elsewhere in the world.
            <br>
            Potential hybrid attacks could span a wide menu of options, including expanding its campaign of sabotage and
            assassinations in Europe or further arming US adversaries in the Middle East and Indo-Pacific regions,
            according to people briefed on the discussions about a potential Russian response.
            <br>
            European ministers discussed Russia’s asymmetric warfare during a meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, where the
            foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom accused Russia in a joint
            statement of “systematically attacking European security architecture”.
            <br>
            Speaking in Washington, the US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said: “Generally, we are
            incredibly concerned about hybrid warfare conducted by Russia both in Europe and around the world, and its
            something we have been in close coordination with our European allies and other allies and partners around
            the world.” Referring to the recent sabotage to two under-sea fibre-optic communication cables in the Baltic
            Sea, Miller added that Russia would be “held accountable” for further such actions.
            <br>
            Russia may choose to delay a further escalation ahead of the inauguration of Donald Trump, who has
            threatened to cut aid to Ukraine and broker a peace deal that is strongly expected to favour Russia.
            <br>
            The first Ukrainian attack with Atacms struck an ammunition warehouse in Bryansk region, the New York Times
            reported, citing US and Ukrainian officials. The region lies north-west of the Kursk region where a
            Ukrainian incursion has been under way since early August.
            <br>
            The Ukrainian president, Volodomyr Zelenskyy, did not directly confirm the Bryansk attack but said: “We now
            have Atacms, Ukrainian long-range capabilities, and we will use them.”
            Russia’s defence ministry claimed five of the missiles were shot down and another was damaged. The ministry
            added that debris from the rockets caused a fire at an unnamed military facility. A US official told the
            Associated Press that just two of the missiles were intercepted.
            <br>
            The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has promised to give an “appropriate” response to the first use
            of the US-made missiles, which Vladimir Putin has previously said would be tantamount to Washington and its
            Nato allies entering direct conflict with Russia.
            <br>
            The reports emerged hours after Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine lowering the threshold for
            using nuclear weapons. A spokesperson for the US national security council played down that decision, saying
            the revision had been planned for weeks and that “observing no changes to Russia’s nuclear posture, we have
            not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture or doctrine in response to Russia’s statements today”.
            <br>
            Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, said he would not be deterred by the new doctrine from supporting
            Ukraine. “There’s irresponsible rhetoric coming from Russia, and that is not going to deter our support for
            Ukraine,” he told reporters at the G20 summit in Brazil.
            <br>
            Behind the scenes, US and European officials have also discussed the potential for Russia to step up a
            growing campaign of attacks on US and European infrastructure that has escalated significantly since
            Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
            <br>
            In the joint statement, the UK and EU ministers said Russia’s hybrid attacks were “escalating” and
            “unprecedented in their variety and scale, creating significant security risks”.
